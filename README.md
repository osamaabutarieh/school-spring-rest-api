Note that I made this rest api and appliyed security (Basic Auth) into it so there is three Roles: 
 - EMPLOYEE
 - MANAGER
 - ADMIN
 - STUDENT


And every roles can access api but: 
 - STUDENT => can GET courses/employees/students
 - EMPLOYEE => can GET courses/employees/students
 - MANAGER => can GET/POST/PUT employees/students/courses
 - ADMIN => can DELETE employee/student/courses and GET/POST/PUT (can doing everything)



Also, there is three users: 
 - john => is a employee
 - mary => is a employee & manager
 - susan => is a employee & manager & admin

and the password for three users is : fun123


Have Fun ....
